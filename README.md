# Sons_of_the_Forest_PXM
 Project X Mod for Sons of the Forest
 
Current features:

1. Mod Menu for some basic commands (binds to "~")
2. Many new and old (The Forest) crafting recipes to craft basic items [ie: 5 Leaves = 1 Cloth, 7 Cloth = 1 Rope], making gathering for yourself more rewarding.
3. Many new crafting recipes to craft most items [ie: Ammo, Weapons, etc.] to make going into caves mostly optional.

Installation:

Copy the files here into the game directory. That is all.
